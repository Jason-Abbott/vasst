The following web server permissions are required by VASST.com.  Please note
that these permissions must be applied to the folders themselves, not just to
the files within the specified folders, in order for the permissions to
propagate to future folder content.

NECESSARY FILE SYSTEM PERMISSIONS ---------------------------------------------

	Default for all folders (some of which have their own ASP classic
	requirements) except

	/data
	/files
	/images/generated
	/images/person
	
	For these, including any sub-folders, the ASP.NET machine account needs
		modify, execute, list, read, write

NECESSARY HTTP PERMISSIONS ----------------------------------------------------

	Default for all folders except

	/content
	/files
	/data

	Disable both read and write HTTP access for these folders.
		
	Explanation:
		Files within these folders are utilized by the application and not
		intended for direct client access.  For example, we want to deny
		access if a user attempts http://vasst.com/data/anyfile.txt.

DEFINITIONS -------------------------------------------------------------------

	File system permissions:
		Permissions held in NTFS Access Control Lists (ACLS), usually managed
		by right-clicking a file or folder within Windows Explorer and
		selecting Properties/Security tab.

	HTTP permissions:

		console by right-clicking a file or folder within the web site node

		access checkboxes.

		The Windows account under which ASP.NET applications run, typically
